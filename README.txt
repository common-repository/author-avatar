Add an upload field in the user profile admin to add a custom profile picture into usermeta table.

== Description ==

Add an upload field in the user profile admin - Don't want to use gravatar profile picture, or just don't have one, just download this plugin. It will add a custom field in the user admin with the possibility to upload your own. Once uploaded, it will add the picture url inside the usermeta table so you can easily display it with ` get_the_author_meta ` .

Translation ready and already available in French.

- Easy to use, once activated and your picture uploaded, grab the source url with:

 ` <?php $user_meta_image = esc_attr( get_the_author_meta( 'user_meta_image', get_the_id() ) ); ?> `

Just add an image tag where you want the picture to be displayed like so:

` <img src="<?php echo $user_meta_image;?>" alt="My Custom user Profile Picture"> `

Et voil√†!

It's pretty easy, just change the last parameter "get_the_id()" wjth the id of the user you want to show, as follow:
 ` $user_meta_image = esc_attr(get_the_author_meta('user_meta_image', 1)); `

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
